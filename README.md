# WaveTracer by PaToRo @ GlobalGameJam 2017 Trier

## Gameplay
You and up to 4 friends control colorful squishy blobs though a **wavey** corridor and try to push each other around.
You have 90 seconds to get as many points as possible by not hitting the upper and lower wall. If you hit too often, you will be punished with a small off-screen penalty.

## Mechanics
The game can be controlled with Gamepad and Keyboard. You join by pressing a button or the spacebar.
You move around with the left analog stick, dash with A and resist with B. A keyboard player uses
the arrow keys and A + S.

## Build
This game was made with Visual Studio 2015 and uses MonoGame. All libs are included (VS should fetch missing things via NuGet).
